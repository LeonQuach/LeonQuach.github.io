      <h1>Artist Statement</h1>

      <p>As an artist, I aim to make people see things in the world in a different perspective instead of their own worldview—projecting them into the unknown of their unconsciousness— using of technology like a mirror for the outside world. As a digital media artist is to show the unknown and known, using technology to conceptualize how these intertwine. My process in general would be software tampering, graphic, installations with projections, and experimental technologies. Specifically, I involve many memorable and unusual methods; mixing old technologies with new ones. I have a deep profound interest for ancient ideas, they revolve around universal archetypal patterns found in multiple cultures. There’s is something deeply important and unique it feels like a map of meaning.<br> <br>
I thinks art teaches people how to see, good and evil aspects of the world. An inside to outside approach to my art, unlike outside to inside. My aim is to be able to show an conceptual space between the known and unknown. Display and gripping with dynamism, both expressing emotions of excitement and fear. My process involves using material from universal archetypal motifs. My inspiration is from what I see in today’s culture, growing up within this postmodern culture I noticed people are lost in totalitarian ideologies or nihilism. Nietzsche dilemma: the death of god, Jung was a student of Nietzsche and recommends the way of the individual to revivify the dead gods. In other words Jung recommended the path of individuation. I want my viewers to be able to be enlightened, instead of rejecting their state of being they should improve upon it. Carl Jung, “I will try to explain the term “individuation” as simply as possible. By it I mean the psychological process that makes of a human being an “individual”-a unique, indivisible unit or “whole man”.”
